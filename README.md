# Energy Modelling

## Getting started
To set up a conda environment with correct versions of modules use
`conda env create -f environment.yml` inside of directory.

To activate the environment in conda use `source activate primary` for Linux and OSX and `activate primary` on Windows.

To launch Jupyter Notebooks use `jupyter notebook`.
